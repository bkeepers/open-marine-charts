# OpenMarineCharts

This is an attempt to create modern, beautiful, accurate, and constantly updated marine charts using open data sources, open source tools, and reproducible workflows.

## Data Sources

Here are the data sources currently used to create these charts

- [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) - a public domain map dataset for creating small-scale maps.
- [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) - a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world.
- [GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data-products/gridded-bathymetry-data) - a global terrain model for ocean (and land), providing elevation data, in meters, on a 15 arc-second interval grid.

## Tools

- [tilemaker](https://tilemaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - A tool to create map tiles from OpenStreetMap data and other sources.
- [tileserver-gl](https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl) - A tool to serve map tiles
